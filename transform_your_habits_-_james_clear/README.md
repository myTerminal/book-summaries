# Transform Your Habits - James Clear

## Why Is It So Hard to Stick to Good Habits?

It may be because we usually try to make changes in the wrong way.

## The Common Mistake You Want to Avoid

> Your audacious life goals are fabulous. We’re proud of you for having them. But it’s possible that those goals are designed to distract you from the thing that’s really frightening you - the shift in daily habits that would mean a re-invention of how you see yourself. - Seth Godin

When you hear about a success story, the only thing you know is the event people are talking about. You never hear about the process and the habits that led to the eventual result. These incredible stories trick you into doing too much, too soon. You do not need the overnight success, you need better habits.

Everything that we are today are a result of your habits. What you repeatedly do ultimately forms the person you are, the things you believe, and the personality you portray.

## The Science of How Your Habits Work (The 3 R's f Habit Change)

Every habit follows a simple 3-step pattern:

1. Reminder (the trigger that initiates the behavior)
2. Routine (the behavior itself)
3. Reward (the benefit you gain from doing the behavior)

If the reward is positive, then the cycle forms a positive feedback loop that tells your brain that when the next time this reminder happens, do the same thing.

You can use this structure to create new habits and stick to them.

1. Use a current habit as a reminder for your new one
2. Make your habits incredibly easy to start
3. Always reward yourself

## Identity-Based Habits: How to Actually Stick to Your Goals For the Long-Term

In order to believe in a new identity, we have to prove it to ourselves.

Your current behaviors are simply a reflection of your current identity. Hence, to change your behavior for good, you need to start believing new things about yourself.

### The Recipe for Sustained Success

1. Decide the type of person you want to be
2. Prove it to yourself with small wins

Identity-based habits keep you focused on the right things: like starting small, building your identity, and not worrying about results.

## The Best Way to Start Your New Habit

If you're serious about sticking to good habits, you have to start small.

Form new habits, actions that are so small that you don't even think about them, you simply do them automatically. They are tiny actions that become consistent patterns.

> If you plant the right seed in the right spot, it will grow without further coaxing. I believe this is the best metaphor for creating habits. The “right seed” is the tiny behavior that you choose. The “right spot” is the sequencing - what it comes after. The “coaxing” part is amping up motivation, which I think has nothing to do with creating habits. In fact, focusing on motivation as the key to habits is exactly wrong. Let me be more explicit: If you pick the right small behavior and sequence it right, then you won’t have to motivate yourself to have it grow. It will just happen naturally, like a good seed planted in a good spot. - BJ Fogg

Daily habits - tiny routines that are repeatable - are what make big dreams a reality. Dream big, but start small.

## How to Fit New Habits Into Your Life

Making changes is tough. Whenever your schedule gets crazy, the inertia of life can pull you away from your goals and right back into your old habits.

The one common mistake we often make when it comes to setting goals is, we set a deadline, but not a schedule. With this strategy, if we don't achieve the arbitrary deadline what we set in the beginning, we feel like a failure. The end result is that we often give up if we don't reach our goal by the initial deadline.

Instead of giving yourself a deadline to accomplish a particular goal by, you should choose a goal that is important to you and then set a schedule to work towards it consistently.

If you want to be the type of person who accomplishes things on a consistent basis, then give yourself a schedule to follow, not a deadline to race towards.

## How to Make Big Changes Without Overwhelming Yourself

With keystone habits, you can actually focus on a single thing and improve your life in multiple areas at the same time.

A keystone habit is a behavior or routine that naturally pulls the rest of your life in order. In order to find what your keystone habit is, you can ask yourself the question: "What is that one thing that - when I do it - my day seems to go more smoothly?"

No matter what your keystone habit is, it is worth your time to focus on it and do more of it.

## How to Get Back on Track After Slipping Up

There will always be instances when following your regular routine is basically impossible. Such small hiccups don't make you a failure, they make you human. What separates the most successful people in the world from others isn't their ability to avoid mistakes, it's their ability to get back on track quickly.

The important thing to realize is that the best strategy isn't to avoid failure, it's to plan for it.

### 4 Strategies to "plan for chaos"

1. **Put your habits on your calendar:** Give your habits a time and place to live in your life.
2. **Stick to your schedule, even in small ways:** Find a way to stick to the schedule, no matter how small it is. This strategy allows you to prove to yourself that you can get something done even when the situation isn't ideal.
3. **Have someone who expects something of you:** Simply knowing that a familiar face expects to see you can be enough to get you to show up.
4. **Design your environment for success:** The signs you read, the things that are on your desk at work, the pictures hanging on your wall at home are all pieces of your environment that can trigger you to take different actions.

In the beginning, your healthy habits might take two steps forward and one step back. Anticipating those backward steps and developing a plan for getting back on track quickly can make all difference in the world.

## How to Break a Bad Habit (and Replace it With a Good One)

Bad habits are caused by two things: stress and boredom.

You can teach yourself new and healthy ways to deal with stress and boredom, which you can then substitute in place of your bad habits.

All of the habits that you have right now - good or bad - are in your life for a reason. In some way, these behaviors provide a benefit to you, even if they are bad for you in other ways. These benefits extend to smaller bad habits as well.

It's very difficult to simply eliminate bad habits as they provide some type of benefit in your life. Hence you need to  **replace a bad habit with a new habit** that provides a similar benefit.

You can **cut out as many triggers as possible**, the ones that lead to your bad habits. Change the environment and you can change the outcome.

**Joining forces with somebody.** The two of you can hold each other accountable and celebrate your victories together. Knowing that someone else expects you to be better is a powerful motivator.

**Visualize yourself succeeding.** See yourself building a new identity.

**You don't need to be someone else, you just need to return to the old you.** You already have inside of you, that person without the bad habits that you want to become. Even if that was years ago, you have already lived without that bad habit, which means you can most definitely do it again.

**Use the word 'but' to overcome negative self-talk.** Every time you slip up or make a mistake, it's easy to tell yourself how much you suck. Whenever that happens, finish the sentence with "but".

**Plan for failure.** We all get off the track, what separates top performers from everyone else is that they get back on track very quickly.

You can make yourself feel guilty or spend time dreaming about how you wish things were - but these thoughts take you away from what's actually happening. Track how many times per day your bad habit happens. The initial goal should be to be aware of when it happens and how often. Then you can start to implement the ideas to break your bad habits (and replace them with good habits).

You may try and fail multiple times before you can make it work. Just because you might not have success initially, it doesn't mean you can't have it all.
