## How to Find Your Hidden Creative Genius

It is typical for creative geniuses to work for decades to master their craft. You need to have decades of practice before you could produce incredible work.

## How Creative Geniuses Come Up With Great Ideas

*The Book Thief* is a book by Markus Zusak has stayed on the New York Times best-seller list for over 230 weeks, selling 8 million copies, was translated into 40 languages and a few years later the a movie was made based on the book. The author wrote the book about 200 times before he could call it complete. In an interview he said, "In three years, I must have failed over a thousand times, but each failure brought me close to what I need to write, and for that, I'm grateful."

### The Simple Secret to Having Good Luck

Blockbuster successes are not just luck. However, if you revise your work enough number of times, you would get better at your craft and then luck seems to have a way to find you.

Creative geniuses keep repeating and retrying through their will and perseverance. In that way, they earn the chance to be lucky by showing up repeatedly.

### How Creativity Works

The only way to release the creative genius inside of us is to work on it. You need to work hard at your ideas and you could uncover more creative powers by forcing yourself to create consistently.

## How to Uncover Your Creative Talent by Using the "Equal Odds Rule"

> The Equal Odds Rule says that the average publication of any particular scientist does not have any statistically different chance of having more of an impact that any other scientist's average publication.

This means that any scientist is equally likely to create a game-changing piece of work as they are to create something average that is to be quickly forgotten.

The conclusion is that because you can't predict your success, the best strategy is to produce as much work as possible, so that you given the probability, you will have more chance of creating something meaningful.

### The Willingness to Create Garbage

Creative genius only reveals itself after you've shown up enough times to get the average ideas out of the way. Sometimes you'll create something good, sometimes you'll create something useless. Regardless, you should always keep creating.

If you want to create a masterpiece, you have to be willing to create a little garbage along the way.

## The Myth of Creative Inspiration

Many of the world's greatest artists follow a consistent schedule. The work of top creatives isn't dependent upon motivation and inspiration, but rather it follows a consistent pattern and routine.

### Daily Routines

William James, the famous psychologist, is noted for saying that habits and schedules are important because they "free our minds to advance to really interesting fields of action."

An article in The Guardian agreed by saying, "If you waste resources trying to decide when or where to work, you'll impede your capacity to do the work."

In other words, if you're serious about creating something compelling, you need to stop waiting for motivation and inspiration to strike you and simply set a schedule for doing work on a consistent basis. Of course, that's easy to say, but much harder to do in practice.

### Permission to Create Junk

You can't selectively choose your best moments and only work on the days when you have great ideas. The only way to unveil the great ideas inside of you is to go through a volume of work, put in your repetitions, and show up over and over again.

You have to grind through the occasional days of below average work because it's the price you have to pay to get the excellent work.

### The Schedule is the System

The schedule is the system that makes your goals a reality. If you don't set a schedule for yourself, then your only option is to rely on motivation.

Stop waiting for motivation or inspiration to strike you and set a schedule for your habits.

## The Difference Between Professionals and Amateurs

### The Difference Between Professionals and Amateurs

It doesn't matter what you are trying to become better at, if you only do the work when you're motivated, then you'll never be consistent enough to become a professional.

The ability to show up everyday, stick to the schedule, and do the work -
especially when you don't feel like it - is so valuable that it is literally all you need to become better 99% of the time.

### The Pain of Being a Pro

Being a pro is painful. When you set a schedule for any task and start sticking to it, there will be days when you feel like quitting. But stepping up when it's annoying or painful or draining to do so, that's what makes you a pro.

Professionals stick to the schedule, amateurs let life get in the way. Professionals know what is important to them and work towards it with purpose, amateurs get pulled off course by the urgencies of life.

### You'll Never Regret Starting Important Work

Being a pro is about having the discipline to commit to what is important to you instead of merely saying something is important to you. It's about starting when you feel like stopping, not because you want to work more, but because your goal is important enough to you that you don't simply work on it when it's convenient. Becoming a pro is about making your priorities a reality.

Becoming a pro doesn't mean you're a workaholic. It means that you're good at making time for what matters to you - especially when you don't feel like it - instead of playing the role of the victim and letting life happen to you.

## How to Become a Pro

1. Decide what you want to be good at
2. Set a schedule for your actions
3. Stick to your schedule for one week

### The Power of the Schedule

> "The most important thing you can do is do a lot of work. Do a huge volume of work. Put yourself on a deadline so that every week or every month you know you're going to finish one story. It is only by going through a volume of work that ... the work you're making will be as good as your ambitions." - Ira Glass

If you want to do your best creative work, then don't leave it up to choice. Don't wake up in the morning and think, "I hope I feel inspired to create something today." You need to take the decision-making out of it. Set a schedule for your work. Genius arrives when you show up enough times to get the average ideas out of the way.

### The Power of Constraints

Setting limits for yourself - whether that involves the time you have to work out, the money you have to start a business, or the number of words you can use in a book - often delivers better results than "keeping your options open."

1. Constraints inspire your creativity
2. Constraints force you to get something done

### Constraints are Not the Enemy

Constraints are not the enemy. Once you know your constraints, you can start figuring out to work with them.

### The Size of Your Canvas

We all have constraints in our lives. The limitations just determine the size of the canvas you have to work with. What you paint on it is up to you.

## How to Be Motivated to Create Consistently

### The Power of Ritual

> "I begin each day of my life with a ritual; I wake up at 5:30 A.M., put on my workout clothes, my leg warmers, my sweatshirts, and my hat. I walk outside my Manhattan home, hail a taxi, and tell the driver to take me to the Pumping Iron gym at 91st street and First Avenue, where I workout for two hours. The ritual is not the stretching and weight training I put my body through each morning at the gym; the ritual is the cab. The moment I tell the driver where to go I have completed the ritual. Itâ€™s a simple act, but doing it the same way each morning habitualizes it - makes it repeatable, easy to do. It reduces the chance that I would skip it or do it differently. It is one more item in my arsenal of routines, and one less thing to think about." - Twyla Tharp

### The Surprising Thing About Motivation

If you have trouble sticking to good habits or fall victim to bad ones, then it can be easy to assume that you simply need to learn how to get motivated or that you don't understand how willpower works. But here is the surprising thing about motivation: it often comes after starting a new behavior, not before. Getting started is a form of active inspiration that naturally produces momentum.

This is basically Newton's First Law applied to habit formation: objects in motion tend to stay in motion. And that means getting started is the hardest part.

### Rituals Are an On Ramp for Your Behavior

The power of a ritual, or what I like to call a pre-game routine, is that it provides a mindless way to initiate your behavior. It makes starting your habits easier and that means following through on a consistent basis is easier.

### The Idea in Practice

Whatever your ritual is, use it as an on-ramp for the bigger behavior and habits you want to build into your life. When you master the ability to mindlessly initiate the tasks that are important to you, it's not necessary to rely on motivation and willpower to make them happen.

## Smart People Should Create Things

### Create Something Small

When the world presents you with something interesting or frustrating or curious, choose to do something about it. Choose to be a creator.

The world needs smart people to build things. And perhaps the most important thing to realize is that we not only need to create for each other, but for ourselves as well. Creating something is the perfect way to avoid wasting the precious moments that we have been given. To contribute, to create, to chip in to the world around you and to add your line to the world's story - that is a life well lived.
